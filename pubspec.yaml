# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/construction.png
    - assets/images/pricelist-header.png
    - assets/images/home-header.png
    - assets/images/playground.png
    - assets/images/plastics.jpg
    - assets/images/truck.png
    - assets/images/pending-truck.png
    - assets/images/1_sign_in.png
    - assets/data/pricelist.json
    - assets/images/scrapcycle-logo.png
    - assets/images/categories/battery.png
    - assets/images/categories/ewaste.png
    - assets/images/categories/glass.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

flutter_icons:
  image_path: assets/images/scrapcycle-logo.png

  fonts:
    - family: Inter
      fonts:
      - asset: android/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf

    - family: Inter-Thin
      fonts:
      - asset: android/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
